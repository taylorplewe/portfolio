		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>I'm from Spanish Fork, UT and I'm 24 years old, I've been programming since I was about twelve or thirteen years old, my Dad taught me the basics of HTML and CSS, I got books about JavaScript and C# and mostly taught myself.  I've always been programming, it's what I do in my free time, I like writing games and other projects.  I love listening to music and I like country, rap, classic rock, indie rock, post rock, classical music.  I love watching sports and I follow BYU football, the Denver Broncos, Utah Jazz, Boston Red Sox.  I like longboarding and doing other outside stuff.</p>
